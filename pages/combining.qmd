## Task 3: Combining Excel and Delimited Data

#### Clean white wine data:

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

white_wine <- read_excel("white_wine.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 1, col_names = FALSE)
variable_names <- read_excel("white_wine.xlsx", sheet = 2)
white_wine

#rename var names
variable_names_extracted <- as.character(variable_names[[1]])
colnames(white_wine) <- variable_names_extracted

#add column to indicate white wine
white_wine2 <- white_wine |>
  mutate(type = "white")
white_wine2
```

#### Clean red wine data:

```{r}
library(readr)

#red_wine <- read_csv2("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/red-wine.csv")
red_wine <- read_delim(
  "https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/red-wine.csv",
  delim = ";",
)
#rename var names
variable_names_extracted <- as.character(variable_names[[1]])
colnames(red_wine) <- variable_names_extracted

#add column to indicate red wine
red_wine2 <- red_wine |>
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.numeric)) |>
  mutate(type = "red")

```

#### Combine and process red and white wine data sets

```{r}

combined_wine <- bind_rows(white_wine2, red_wine2, .id = NULL)

combined_wine2 <- combined_wine |>
  filter (quality > 6.5 & alcohol < 132) |>
  arrange (desc(quality)) |>
  select(contains("acid"), alcohol, type, quality) |>
  group_by(quality) |>
  mutate(alcohol_mean = mean(alcohol, na.rm = TRUE), alcohol_sd = sd(alcohol, na.rm = TRUE ))
  
combined_wine2

```
